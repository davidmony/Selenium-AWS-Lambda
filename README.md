# Selenium-AWS-Lambda
In the project I run a selenium-based web scraper using AWS lambda functions. The purpose of the project was to scrape company websites for internship opportunities; however, the code here could also be used as a reference on how to deploy selenium as a serverless lambda function to do periodic jobs like data-scraping and automation work.
